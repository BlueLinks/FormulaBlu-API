## 📋 OpenAPI Specification (OAS) Structure

### 🎯 OAS Goals

-   **Shared Models** → Reusable request/response models across microservices
-   **Feign Client Generation** → Auto-generate Feign clients from OAS specifications
-   **API Documentation** → Auto-generated documentation from OAS files
-   **Contract Testing** → Ensure API implementations match specifications

### 📁 OAS Directory Structure

```

### 🚧 OAS Implementation Status

#### ✅ In Progress

-   [x] Create OAS directory structure
-   [x] Define common models (Error, Pagination, etc.)
-   [x] Create API specifications for each microservice
-   [x] Fix TypeSpec syntax issues for compatibility with TypeSpec 0.50.0
-   [x] Fix GitHub workflow issues (deprecated actions, validation, error handling)
-   [ ] Implement model sharing mechanism
-   [ ] Set up Feign client generation
-   [ ] Integrate OAS with microservices

#### 📝 Benefits

-   **Consistency** → All APIs follow the same patterns and conventions
-   **Reusability** → Models can be shared across services
-   **Type Safety** → Generated clients provide compile-time type checking
-   **Documentation** → Always up-to-date API documentation
-   **Testing** → Contract testing ensures API compliance

## 🔗 Service Integration Design

### Current Integration Status

-   **API Gateway** → Routes requests to appropriate services
-   **Database Isolation** → Each service has its own database
-   **Service Discovery** → Using Kubernetes service names (Eureka removed)

### Integration Patterns Needed

-   **Data Synchronization** → How services share reference data
-   **Event Communication** → How services notify each other of changes
-   **Data Aggregation** → How Championship API gets data from other services
-   **Caching Strategy** → How to cache frequently accessed data
